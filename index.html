                    <p>
                        Fr, we're not your dad's hedge fundâ€”unless your dad is a partner at Goldman. We grew up talking puts and calls at the dinner table. Our network isn't just built, it's inherited. We keep our expense ratios low-key because our trust funds are bussin'. That means more of your money goes to work. We still hustle, we just have a different starting line.

                    <p>It's giving... legacy access with a glow up.</p>
